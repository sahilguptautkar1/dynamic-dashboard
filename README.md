# Dynamic-Dashboard (CNAPP Dashboard)

## Deployed Link
https://dynamic-dashboard-assignment.netlify.app/

## Overview:
The CNAPP Dashboard is a React-based application designed to provide a user-friendly interface for managing and monitoring various categories of widgets. Each category, such as CSPM, CWPP, and Registry Scan, has its own set of widgets displayed as interactive charts, offering insights into different data points.

## Project Objectives:
- ### Data Visualization: 
    To enable users to visualize data in a concise and easy-to-understand format using different types of charts (Doughnut, Bar, Line).
- ### Dynamic Widget Management: 
    Allow users to add, remove, and filter widgets dynamically within each category.
- ### Search and Filter Functionality: 
    Implement a search bar to quickly locate specific widgets and a filtering mechanism, within a side dialog, to personalize the dashboard view.
- ### Responsive Design: 
    Ensure that the dashboard is fully responsive and works across various devices and screen sizes.

## Key Features:
- ### Multi-Category Support:
    - The dashboard supports multiple categories (CSPM, CWPP, Registry Scan) with unique widgets for each, that are displayed as charts and can be managed independently.

- ### Widget Management:
    - ##### Add Widgets - 
        Users can add new widgets to each category via a user-friendly interface.
    - ##### Remove Widgets - 
       Existing widgets can be easily removed, allowing for dynamic dashboard customization.
- ### Search Functionality:
    - A search bar allows users to find widgets based on their names quickly.
    - The search input automatically clears when clicking the "Filter Widgets" button to ensure the most relevant widgets are displayed.
- ### Responsive UI:
    - The dashboard is designed with responsiveness in mind, ensuring it looks good and functions well on all screen sizes.
- ### Optimized Performance:
    - The code is optimized for better performance by reducing redundant CSS and simplifying the component structure.

## Technology Stack:
    - Front-End: React.js, Material-UI
    - State Management: Redux
    - Charting Library: Chart.js
    - Version Control: Git

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs all required dev dependencies

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
